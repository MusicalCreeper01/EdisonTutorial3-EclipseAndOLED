# EdisonTutorial3-EclipseAndOLED

This is the code from my third Intel Edison tutorial on creating a simle OLED battery monitor using SparkFun blocks.

All the code in the SparkFun folder is from the SparkFun Github repo for the OLED block https://github.com/sparkfun/Edison_OLED_Block/tree/master/Firmware/pong
